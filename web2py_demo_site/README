demo

when a field is submitted, it’s filtered through the accepts method from the Controller, according to the requirements specified in the database schema (IS_NOT_EMPTY). If the field meets the requirement (accepts returns True), it’s passed to form.vars; if not (accepts returns False), an error populates, which is then stored in form.errors.
